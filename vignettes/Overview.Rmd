An overview of the COPASutils package
========================================================

In this example, we will be using the COPASutils package to read in, process, and analyze data resulting fram a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) using *Caenorhabditis elegans* nematode worms and a COPAS BIOSORT large particle flow cytometer. This example assumes that the COPASutils package is installed, with all necessary dependecies on your local machine. To install the COPASutils package, you can use the command `install.packages("COPASutils")`.

We will begin by requiring the COPASutils package so that we can utilize the associated functions and example data:

```{r set-options, echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
options(width = 120)
opts_knit$set(root.dir = "../data")
```

```{r message=FALSE}
require(COPASutils)
```

## Reading Data

We can now read in the plate data from one of the example data sets. In the GWAS experimental design, each plate is set up with three worms sorted to each well in every other column. We have included an example data set, called "control_setup.txt" that illustrates this step of the experiment and we will read this file in first and save it to a data frame called `setupRaw`:

```{r}
setupRaw <- readPlate("plateData1.txt")
```

If we look at the head of this data frame we can begin to step through the different data that are output by the COPAS machine:

```{r}
head(setupRaw)
```

We can see that the COPAS machine groups the output data primarily by row and column of a 96-well plate, represented by the columns `row` and `col` in the above data farme. Each row in the data frame represents the readings for a single object. Working through the columns left to right, we see that the sorter returns the sort status of the object in the `sort` column (for our purposes, we are only concerned with instances where sort = 6, as these worms were sorted to the repective wells in the target plate). We then see `TOF` which stands for "time of flight" or a measure of the legth of the object in microns. Next is `EXT` or "extinction", a measure of the optical density of the object . Following this is the `time` column which represents the relative time from the first object sorted in each well. Using this scheme, the first object to pass through the flow cell for each well with therefore be assigned a time of 0. Next are the peak height values for each of the fluorescence channels, indicated by the `green`, `yellow`, and `red` columns. The next four columns contain the data for the normalized EXT, red, green, abd yellow values (value/`TOF`). Lastly the columns `object` and `call50` represent data returned from the support vector machine (SVM) that probabilistically determines whether each "object" is actually an object (cell, worm, etc.) or whether it is a bubble. This feature is useful if the experiments, like ours, requires the bubble trap hardware to be bypassed. `call50` displays "bubble" if the probability of being an object (`object`) is greater than .5, or "bubble" otherwise.

If you would like to remove the last two columns (i.e. read in data without the help of the SVM), you can set the `SVM` argument to FALSE, as below:

```{r}
setupRaw2 <- readPlate("plateData1.txt", SVM=FALSE)
head(setupRaw2)
```

We can also set cutoffs for minimum and maximum time of flight and extinction values as such:

```{r}
setupRaw3 <- readPlate("plateData1.txt", tofmin=60, tofmax=1000, extmin=50, extmax=500)
head(setupRaw3)
```

## Processing Data

Now that we have read our raw data into R using the `readPlate` function, we probably want to summarize the data by well. We are not necessarily interested in the data at the per object level, but it would be nice to get some summary statistics for each well. For instance, in the GWAS experiement from we which are examining the data, it is desired that 3 worms be sorted into each well in every other column. To summarize the data we can use the `summarizePlate` function:

```{r warning=FALSE}
setupSummarized <- summarizePlate(setupRaw)
colnames(setupSummarized)
```

We now see that we have many more trait variables, many of which describe the distribution of the originally measured values by well. We can get an even more complete picture by adding in extra quantiles (`quantiles` argument), log transformed values of EXT and the fluorescence channels (`log` argument), and the minimum and maximum of each trait (`ends` argument), as below:

```{r warning=FALSE}
setupSummarized2 <- summarizePlate(setupRaw, quantiles=TRUE, log=TRUE, ends=TRUE)
colnames(setupSummarized2)
```

We now have a great deal of information describing, in detail, the distribution of each of the measured traits. Again, each subset of new trait values can be removed by leaving each of the optional parameters (quantiles, log, and ends) set to `FALSE`. Each trait follows a specific naming system, wherein any mathematical transformation imparted on the original data is added at the beggining of the trait. For instance, the mean of all of the time of flight data (TOF) for each well can be found in the column `mean.TOF`. If we wanted the column corresponding to the 25th quantile of the log transformed extinction data (EXT), we could find it in the column named `q25.log.EXT`. All of the naming conventions are outlined in the table below:

Statistic                       |  Abbreviation  |  Example
:------------------------------:|:--------------:|:-----------------:
mean                            |  mean          |  mean.TOF
median                          |  median        |  median.EXT
minimum                         |  min           |  min.yellow
maximum                         |  max           |  max.green
normalized to time of flight    |  norm          |  mean.norm.red
quantiles                       |  qXX           |  q25.red
log transformed data            |  log           |  mean.log.red

Some statistics, such as normalized and log values are calculated before the data are summarized and, as such, have a distribution of their own. For these traits, all mean, median, min, max and quantile data are available by stringing together names as in the above table.

In the experiment we are examining here, no worms were sorted into the wells in the even columns. Therefore, the data we are seeing in these columns are the result of background debris or accidental placement of worms into the wells. We probably want to remove these wells before we continue with our analysis. Included in the package is a function that does exactly that. The `removeWells` function does exactly what its name implies:

```{r}
setupSummarized3 <- removeWells(setupSummarized, c("A2", "A4", "A6")) # All wells you want to remove need to be included here
head(setupSummarized3[,1:10])
```

The `removeWells` function takes as input a data frame, summarized or unsummarized, as well as a vector of string corresponding to wells to be removed and returns the data frame with all phenotype data in the frame set to NA. An optional `drop` parameter is used to specify whether to "NA out" trait data or drop those rows from the frame entirely:

```{r}
setupSummarized4 <- removeWells(setupSummarized, c("A2", "A4", "A6"), drop=TRUE)
head(setupSummarized4[,1:10])
```

The converse of the `removeWells` function is the `fillWells` function. This function fills the trait data for any wells missing from the selected data frame with `NA`s. If want to fill the wells back in from our example above, where the rows were dropped from the data frame, we could use the following command:

```{r}
setupSummarized5 <- fillWells(setupSummarized4)
head(setupSummarized5[,1:10])
```

One issue when working with 96-well plates is that of placement within the plate. Edge wells, being exposed to more direct dry air currents, may experience greater evaporation, which may have an effect on different traits of in those wells. To test this hypothesis, we can utilize the `edgeEffect` function:

```{r}
edgeEffect(setupSummarized, "n")
```

This function takes a summarized plate data frame and the name of the trait to test. In this instance we tested our setup plate for any effect with respect to the number of worms in each well. The function splits the plate population by wells found on the perimeter of the plate and those found on the interior, then performs a Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test between the two populations for the specified trait. Th resultant p-value is returned. Since te returned p-value does not exceed our significance threshold of .05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the two populations are drawn from the same distribution. If we want to simultaneously test all trait, we can not specify the trait to be tested and data frame of all traits and associated p-values will be returned.

## Plotting Data

Now that we have access to both the unsummarized and summarized data, we would like to visualize the results from this plate. The plate in this example was set up with worms in every other column. To confirm that large populations only exist in every other columns, we will plot a heat map of the plate representing the population present in each well using the `plotTrait` function: 

```{r warning=FALSE, fig.width=10}
plotTrait(setupSummarized, "n")
```

We can see that the larger populations of worms are, in fact, only present in every other well, row-wise. The returned plot is a ggplot2 object and as such can be manipulated using standard ggplot2 functions. This is true for all of the following plotting functions as well. For instance, we can add a title as such:

```{r warning=FALSE, fig.width=10}
plotTrait(setupSummarized, "n") + ggtitle("Example Heatmap")
```

We are not simply limited to heatmaps, however. By plotting the raw data, we can get a better feel for the distributions of the traits. We can plot a histogram of the values in each well:

```{r warning=FALSE, fig.width=10}
plotTrait(setupRaw, "TOF", type="hist")
```

Or we can plot a scatter plot between two traits:

```{r warning=FALSE, fig.width=10}
plotTrait(setupRaw, "TOF", "EXT", type="scatter")
```

We may also want to compare how traits differ across plates. Included in the package is a function called `plotCompare` that accomplishes this very task. Here, we'll compare the distributions of the time-of-flight values between the data in `setupRaw` and a new plate called `scoreRaw`. These two plates will be entered as a list to the first argument in the function. Then, we'll specify the trait to be compared (`TOF` in this case). Finally we'll enter in a vector of the plates names as the optional third argument:

```{r warning=FALSE, fig.width=10}
scoreRaw <- readPlate("plateData2.txt")
plotCompare(list(setupRaw, scoreRaw), "TOF", plateNames=c("Setup", "Score"))
```

We can see that side by side box plots are plotted for the values in each well. Likewise, we can compare the summarized values between plates by feeding in summarized plate data:

```{r warning=FALSE, fig.width=10}
scoreSummarized <- summarizePlate(scoreRaw)
plotCompare(list(setupSummarized, scoreSummarized), "mean.TOF", plateNames=c("Setup", "Score"))
```

In addition, we can also check for correlation between traits both within and across plates using a new function called `plotCorMatrix`. This function will plot a correlation heatmap between all of the traits either within or between summarized plates. Hew we will examine correlations between traits within the summarized setup data:

```{r warning=FALSE, fig.width=10}
plotCorMatrix(setupSummarized)
```

In the above matrix we can see that some traits are positively correlated, some are negatively correlated, and some are completely uncorrelated. We can also examine these patterns between plates as such:

```{r warning=FALSE, fig.width=10}
plotCorMatrix(setupSummarized, scoreSummarized)
```

If we now transition to some new data, representing an experiment in which drug dose response curves were measured, we can utilize our the last plot function in the package, `plotDR`. We will first read in our example data set, called `"doses.txt"`. We will then summarize this data, filling in the strains with a 96 element vector sorresponding to the names of the strains across a plate, row-wise.

```{r}
dosesRaw <- readPlate("doseData.txt")
strains <- rep(c("Strain 1", "Strain 2", "Strain 3", "Strain 4"), each=6, times=4)
dosesSummarized <- summarizePlate(dosesRaw, strains)
doses <- rep(c(0,2.5,5,10,20,NA), times=16)
plotDR(dosesSummarized, dosages=doses, trait="mean.TOF")
```

We can see that we now need to include the strains vector when summarizing the data as well as a dosages vector when plotting the dose response. We also might like to see how the strains vary across every trait. We can generate a list of ggplot2 objects using the `plotDR_allTraits` function:

```{r}
plotList <- plotDR_allTraits(dosesSummarized, dosages=doses)
```

We can even access each plot by name using the scheme below:

```{r}
plotList$median.red
plotList$mean.EXT
```

## Conclusion

The COPASutils package provides quick, streamlined tools for reading, processing, and plotting much of the data resulting COPAS platform machines. Here we have analyzed data from several different experiments. Of course analysis pipelines for the data will change from project to project and the pipeline described here may or mey not be the best fit for your data. COPASutils provides a very general and flexible workflow for COPAS data and should be easily adapted to your specific project.
