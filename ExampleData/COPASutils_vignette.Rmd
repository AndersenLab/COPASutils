Using the COPASutils package to read, process, and analyze COPAS data
========================================================

In this example, we will be using the COPAStools package to read in, process, and analyze data resulting fram a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) using *Caenorhabditis elegans* nematode worms and a COPAS BIOSORT large particle flow cytometer. This example assumes that the COPASutils package is installed, with all necessary dependecies on your local machine. To install the COPASutils package, you can use the command `install.packages("COPASutils")`.

We will begin by requiring the COPASutils package so that we can utilize the associated functions and example data.

```{r}
require(COPASutils)
```

## Reading Data

We can now read in the plate data from one of the example data sets. In the GWAS experimental design, each plate is set up with three worms sorted to each well in every other column. We have included an example data set, called "control_setup.txt" that illustrates this step of the experiment and we will read this file in first and save it to a data frame called `setupRaw`.

```{r}
setupRaw <- readPlate("control_setup.txt")
```

If we look at the head of this data frame we can begin to step through the different data that are output by the COPAS machine.

```{r}
head(setupRaw)
```

We can see that the COPAS machine groups the output data primarily by row and column of a 96-well plate, represented by the columns `row` and `col` in the above data farme. Each row in the data frame represents the readings for a single object. Working through the columns left to right, we see that the sorter returns the sort status of the object in the `sort` column (for our purposes, we are only concerned with instances where sort = 6, as these worms were sorted to the repective wells in the target plate). We then see `TOF` which stands for "time of flight" or a measure of the legth of the object in microns. Next is `EXT` or "extinction", a measure of the optical density of the object . Following this is the `time` column which represents the relative time in milliseconds???? from the first object sorted per each in well. Using this scheme, the first object to pass through the flow cell for each well with therefore be assigned a time of 0. Next are the peak height values for each of the fluorescence channels, indicated by the `green`, `yellow`, and `red` columns. The next four columns contain the data for the normalized EXT, red, green, abd yellow values (value/`TOF`). Lastly the columns `object` and `call50` represent data returned from the support vector machine that probabilistically determines whether each "object" is actually an object (cell, worm, etc.) or whether it is a bubble. This feature is useful if the experiments, like ours, requires the bubble trap hardware to be bypassed. `call50` displays "bubble" if the probability of being an object (`object`) is greater than .5, or "bubble" otherwise.

If you wuld like to remove the last two columns (i.e. read in data without the help of the SVM), you can set the `SVM` argument to FALSE, as below:

```{r}
setupRaw2 <- readPlate("control_setup.txt", SVM=FALSE)
head(setupRaw2)
```

We can also set cutoffs for minimum and maximum time of flight and extinction values as such:

```{r}
setupRaw3 <- readPlate("control_setup.txt", tofmin=60, tofmax=1000, extmin=50, extmax=500)
head(setupRaw3)
```

## Processing Data

Now that we have read our raw data into R using the `readPlate` function, we probably want to summarize the data by well. We are not necessarily interested in the data at the per object level, but it would be nice to get some summary statistics for each well. For instance, in the GWAS experiement from which are examining the data, it is desired that 3 worms be sorted into each well in every other column. To summarize the data we can use the `summarizePlate` function.

```{r}
setupSummarized <- summarizePlate(setupRaw)
colnames(setupSummarized)
```

We now see that we have many more trait variables, many of which describe the distribution of the originally measured values by well. We can get an even more complete picture by adding in extra quantiles (`quantiles` argument), log transformed values of EXT and the fluorescence channels (`log` argument), and the minimum and maximum of each trait (`ends` argument), as below:

```{r}
setupSummarized2 <- summarizePlate(setupRaw, quantiles=TRUE, log=TRUE, ends=TRUE)
colnames(setupSummarized2)
```

We now have a great deal of information describing, in detail, the distribution of each of the measured traits. Again, each subset of new trait values can be removed by leaving each of the optional parameters (quantiles, log, and ends in). Each trait follows a specific naming system, wherein any mathematical transformation imparted on the original data is added at the beggining of the trait. For instance, the mean of all of the time of flight data (TOF) for each well can be found in the column `mean.TOF`. If wanted the column colrresponding to the 25th quantile of the log transformed extinction data (EXT), we could find it in the column named `q25.log.EXT`. All of the naming conventions are outlined in the table below:

Statistic                       |  Abbreviation  |  Example
:------------------------------:|:--------------:|:-----------------:
mean                            |  mean          |  mean.TOF
median                          |  median        |  median.EXT
minimum                         |  min           |  min.yellow
maximum                         |  max           |  max.green
normalized to time of flight    |  norm          |  mean.norm.red
quantiles                       |  qXX           |  q25.red
log transformed data            |  log           |  mean.log.red

Some statistics, such as norm and log values are calculated before the data are summarized and, as such, have a distribution of their own. For these traits, all mean, median, min, max and quantile data are available by stringing together names as in the above table.
