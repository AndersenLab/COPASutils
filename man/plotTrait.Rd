\title{Create faceted plots for every well in a 96-well plate}
\usage{
plotTrait(plate, trait, trait2 = NULL, type = "heat")
}
\arguments{
\item{plate}{a plate data frame, either summarized or unsummarized, to plot}

\item{trait}{the trait to plot in a heatmap or histogram or the independent variable in a scatterplot, enter as a string}

\item{trait2}{the trait which will be the dependent variable for the scatter plot, enter as a string}

\item{type}{the type of plot, either "heat" for heatmap, "scatter" for scatter plot, or "hist" for histogram, defaults to "heat"}
}
\description{
Returns ggplot2 object that is facted by row and column. By default, it will plot a heat map for the trait specified as a string. Other options include scatterplots and histograms.
}
\examples{
plotTrait(plate, "n") #will create a heatmap of the number of objects per well from summarized data
plateTrait(plate, "TOF", "EXT", "scatter") #will create a scatter plot of EXT by TOF for each well
plateTrait(plate, "TOF", type="hist") #will create a histogram of TOF for each well
}
